# rmangal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mangal-wg/rmangal.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mangal-wg/rmangal)

`rmangal` is a `R` package to interact with APIs implementing the `mangal`
data specification for the representation of ecological networks. As of yet,
the only such database is hosted by the Université du Québec à Rimouski,
and can be accessed at `http://mangal.uqar.ca/`.

In addition to the vignettes, a short introduction to the use of `rmangal`
can be found on the `mangal` website, at <http://mangal.uqar.ca/doc/rmangal/>.

## Version numbers

`rmangal` uses [semantic versioning][semver]. The version numbering
scheme is `major`.`minor`.`revision`. Unless `major` is 1, the package
should not be considered stable. All releases with the same `major`
versions are compatible. Increases in `minor` represents the addition of
backwards-compatible additions. Increases in `revision` represents either
bug fixes or improvements.
