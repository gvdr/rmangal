`rmangal` is a `R` package to interact with APIs implementing the `mangal`
data specification for the representation of ecological networks. As of yet,
the only such database is hosted by the Université du Québec à Rimouski,
and can be accessed at `http://mangal.uqar.ca/`.

In addition to the vignettes, a short introduction to the use of `rmangal`
can be found on the `mangal` website, at `coming.soon/doc/rmangal/`.
