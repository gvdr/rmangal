# rmangal - R access to hosted MANGAL API

The `mangal` project is a [data specification][dataspec] and [API][api], desgined to facilitate the retrieval, archival, and re-use of data on ecological interactions.

# An overview of the mangal format

%%TODO general statement about the philosophy

## Informations about interactions

## Informations about network nodes

# Getting to know the API

The only information needed to start working is the URL of the database you want to interact with. By default, `rmangal` will connect you to the main database (at the Université du Québec à Rimouski).

```{r firstStep}
conn <- mangalAPI()
```

You can check that you have access to the API by saying Hi! to the DB:

```{r sayHi}
sayHi(conn)
```

## Get a list of taxa, and loop through them

## Get the populations of a particular taxa
