# contributing data through R

The goal of this vignette is to present the protocol to *upload* data into the `mangal` database. By default, the `rmangal` package works with the database from the *Université du Québec à Rimouski*, in which data are publicly available under the *Creative Commons 0 waiver*.

Contributing data requires (i) that you have an identifier and password in the database you want to send the data to, and (ii) that the database allows the `POST` methods on the object you want to send.

```{r auth}
netdb <- mangalapi(usr='test', pwd='test')
netdb$taxa$verbs
```

The `verbs` elements for each type of object will tell you which methods can be used (objects are uploaded with `post`).
